    "description": "Most AI chatbots in business today are limited to providing static answers. They can't do anything - they can't update CRM records, send notifications, or automate tasks. This leads to disconnected user experiences and missed opportunities for operational efficiency. As organizations adopt AI copilots across customer service, internal support, and operations, the demand is shifting from passive Q&A bots to intelligent agents that can take action across systems. This requires tight integration with business data and tools like Dynamics 365, Microsoft 365, and third-party systems. Without this, AI remains just a novelty, not a driver of value or ROI. How - Tools & Features to Solve It: In 2025, Microsoft Copilot Studio introduced the Tools pane, a centralized interface for adding actions and data sources to your chatbot. These features empower Copilots to not just talk, but to actâ€”automating tasks like submitting service tickets, scheduling meetings, or logging data into your CRM in real time. In this session: - Learn how to connect Copilot Studio to Dynamics 365, Power Automate, and external systems to build end-to-end business processes within your chatbot. - Discover how generative AI can intelligently decide which action to take, including asking for missing inputs dynamically during the conversation. - Gain practical experience designing Copilot workflows that go beyond answering questions - by performing actions that deliver measurable business value.",

This session dives deep into the rise of Agentic AI and its transformative impact on ERP, with a sharp focus on Business Central. But we won't stop there. We'll explore how other ERP giants are reimagining AI in their platforms, and how their strategies compare to Microsoft's. We'll also examine the broader AI ecosystem: Apple's stumbles with Apple Intelligence, Microsoft's missteps with Windows Recall, and the rise of physical AI from Tesla and Figure. You'll leave with a clear understanding of where AI is headed, what it means for your customers, and how to position yourself at the forefront of this revolution.

    "description": "In industries like Manufacturing, Facility Management, and Energy, the impact of AI will be transformative, but only if solutions address the real demands of operations. For AI to deliver value in maintenance and field service, it must be accessible, practical, and embedded in systems already in use. Maintenance teams need tools that simplify daily work such as creating work orders and tracking requests, while operations managers require support for building preventive plans and deploying predictive maintenance strategies powered by IoT and machine learning. The goal is to extend the expertise of experienced staff by scaling their knowledge through data-driven decision-making. For Microsoft Solutions Partners, the opportunity is clear: deploy AI trained on operational and maintenance dataâ€”not generalized ERP, finance, or HR inputs. Solutions that meet users where they work improve adoption, drive productivity, and make Business Central even more essential to daily operations. With mobiMentor AI, built into TAG Mobi EAM for Microsoft Business Central, Verosoft is delivering a new layer of intelligence that ensures cleaner maintenance data, boosts engagement, and expands ERP value for asset-intensive industries. Meet the Verosoft expert at Directions EMEA 2025 to see how AI designed for maintenance is already increasing user stickiness in Business Central and how it will soon optimize complex workflows as data flows through BC, turning AI from concept into enabler.",

This isn't another workload to bolt on. It's a full-scale business transformationâ€”just as disruptive as the shift to the cloud or the painful journey to SaaS that you may have just finished navigating over the last decade. Now, it's happening again. And this time, it's moving faster. In this provocative and eye-opening session, Sharka Chobot challenges Microsoft partners to confront a critical truth: monetizing AI isn't about technical readinessâ€”it's about business reinvention. Just as the cloud forced you to rethink pricing, packaging, and services, AI is now forcing you to reimagine your identity, revenue model, and go-to-market strategy. You'll explore: â€¢ Why treating AI like just another â€œsolutionâ€ may stall your growth or worse, put your future value at risk â€¢ The organizational shifts required to become an AI-first partner, not a legacy reseller in a new market â€¢ How to move beyond implementation projects to become a trusted AI advisor â€¢ Reinventing continuous-value AI services â€¢ The emotional resistance you and your clients must overcome to lead this transformation â€¢ How to re-establish trust, relevance, and recurring value in the age of Copilot This is not just a sessionâ€”it's your strategic reset.

Meanwhile, B2C and D2C brands are out winning attention, building emotional connections, and driving demand through bold, creative moves. The gap is only growing. 70% of B2B content goes unused, and 80% of buyers now expect a B2C-style experience - fast, personal, and emotionally engaging. Only 5% of B2B buyers are in-market at any one time, which means brand recall matters more than ever. This session shows Microsoft SI's and ISV's how to break out of the â€œsafe but forgettableâ€ playbook - and apply proven tactics from the innovative B2C marketing world to cut through the noise and drive results. You'll leave knowing how to: - Build a brand people remember, trust, and want to buy from - Launch campaigns that spark inbound leads and sales conversations - Inject energy, creativity, and confidence back into your marketing If you're ready to stop going through the marketing motions and start standing out, this is the session for you.",

    "description": "A reality check on building RAG pipelines in ERP contexts, including what works, what doesn't, and what we might do differently next time. RAG is often sold as the future of enterprise AI: combine LLMs with vector search, and suddenly users can â€œtalkâ€ to their data. It sounds great, but what happens when you actually try to implement it in a structured ERP system like Business Central? In this session, I'll share what I've learned from developing a RAG-based prototype inside Business Central. The initial idea was simple: let users select tables and fields that should be semantically searchable, embed their values into a vector index, and connect them to a conversational AI assistant. In practice, the results were mixed. Some things worked well (especially with Copilot assistance in development). Other things, like whether this even needed vectors at all, are still up for debate. You'll learn: - How we built a configurable RAG prototype on top of Business Central - Why semantically matching JSON-structured ERP fields sometimes feels like the wrong abstraction - What to consider before jumping into embeddings and vector search - What I would change if I started again today This session is for technical builders who want more than just AI hype and are curious what happens when you move from cool demos to production constraints, user expectations, and actual data complexity in ERP.",

We'll walk through designing a multi-functional Copilot that uses Dynamic Chaining, Power Automate, and Adaptive Cards to interact with Business Central data, automate tasks, and deliver meaningful results across platforms like Teams, websites, or Copilot for Microsoft 365. From interacting with structured data to sending context-aware communications and triggering process flows, CtrlBC will demonstrate how an AI agent can become a true extension of your operational workflows. Delivered by Tharanga Chandrasekara, Technical Lead and ten-time Microsoft MVP, and Steve Gichure, Founder and Technical Lead at Thamani Tech NZ, this session will energise your Power Platform journey and get you building smarter, faster, and better.",

Code Apps and Generative Pages are Microsoft's answer to bringing vibe-coded (but also traditionally developed pro-code) apps into Power Platform, hosting them on the Power Platform runtime. In this session, Vivian and Yannick will take a closer look under the hood, finding answers to questions: What are these features, how do they work, what do they replace, and when do they make sense to use? Additionally, we have a proven development practice on Power Platform. How do we integrate Code Apps and Generative Pages into this practice so we can continue building robust and scalable solutions using all these new goodies? As solution architects, with Vivian bringing a functional angle to the platform and Yannick having a traditional developer background, they are perfectly placed to provide answers.

    "description": "Before we do the final assembly of a product, we need to move items from the warehouse to the production lines according to the production schedule. The items must arrive before production starts. When there are a high number of configurations and customizations, this becomes a challenge. Complexity arises when you have different sizes of materials in various bins throughout the warehouse, and you need to \"feed\" the production line from different areas at different times. We can use a double-bin system for some of the items, but not for allâ€”so they need to be moved according to the schedule. If we have a large warehouse and need to prepare for more than one order at a time, there are different methods we can use, such as zone picking and batch picking. But today, when we calculate the picking process, are we truly getting the optimal picking strategy for our production? We have various algorithms to optimize the shortest path, like Dijkstra's algorithm or the nearest neighbor algorithm. Some of the bins may need to be split into different sections to support movement calculations for the items. The question is: Can we use Copilot to help us optimize inventory movements for production?",

    "description": "For more than two years now, I have been evangelizing clean code, SOLID principles, and testable architecture. Then AI arrived, and I thought: \"Who cares about clean code when machines can read, write, and maintain any code?\" I was spectacularly wrong. After months of intensive vibe coding and letting AI write most of my code while I directed, reviewed, and fought with the results, I discovered that clean code isn't just still relevant: it's become absolutely critical for survival in an AI-dominated development world. This deep-dive session reveals why the very foundations we've been teaching for decades have become our lifeline in the age of artificial intelligence: - Why programming became AI's first conquest (spoiler: we were never as special as we thought) - How vibe coding simultaneously accelerates and sabotages your projects - The art of prompting AI into SOLID compliance and keeping it there - When to trust the machine and when to grab the wheel back - Why AI naturally produces spaghetti code and how to prevent it - The brutal truth about programmer relevance and how to secure your future (as short as that may be) Through real examples and battle-tested strategies, you'll learn to harness AI's power while maintaining the code quality that separates long-term winners from short-term survivors. Because in a world where anyone can generate code, only those who can generate good code will thrive.",

    "description": "Going live on Business Central Cloud is just the beginning. At Abakion, we believe that long-term customer retention depends on delivering instant value, ensuring availability, and staying relevant throughout the entire customer journey. To support this, we've developed a structured and scalable model based on four customer segmentsâ€”Complex, Active, Curious, and Dormantâ€”each with a tailored journey. Every journey is divided into seven clearly defined phases, and for each phase and segment, we've outlined specific actions and success criteria. This enables us to deliver the right engagement at the right time, based on the customer's actual needs, maturity, and potential. Our approach allows us to stay present and proactive across a growing customer base. It ensures that all customers experience valueâ€”whether highly engaged or more passive. Does this mean we follow a rigid framework? Not at all. The customer journey provides structure and a shared baseline that lets us adapt every interaction to the customer's needs. And gives us the clarity and capacity to deviate when it truly matters. In this session, we'll share how we scale our business to meet the growing number of cloud customers by operationalizing customer success through segmentation, automation, and service design. You'll learn how a structured journey model can help your team grow, stay close to customers, and turn cloud users into loyal, long-term partnersâ€”while building a foundation for sustainable success.",

    "description": "As AI tools become increasingly embedded in how we gather requirements, prototype solutions, and deliver Business Central projects, the skills we rely on as consultants are evolving. From AI-generated documentation to intelligent copilots guiding users in real time, the landscape of Dynamics 365 project delivery is changing fast. But while how we deliver is shifting, the why remains the same and it's still rooted in human connection. In this session, Andy and Phil will explore how AI is reshaping traditional workshop engagements. They will look at why soft skills like empathy, active listening, facilitation, negotiation, and stakeholder management remain essential, but now need to be applied in new and nuanced ways to make the most of the AI tools that are becoming part of everyday delivery. This talk will offer practical tips for consultants and project teams who want to harness AI without losing the human touch. You'll leave with a fresh perspective on how to create meaningful synergy between smart tools and soft skills and why your emotional intelligence might just be your most future-proof asset. Whether you're a functional consultant, project manager, or developer, if you're involved in delivering Dynamics 365 Business Central and supporting users through change and adoption, this session is for you.",

    "description": "Feedback fuels growthâ€”but giving and receiving it isn't always easy. Why does feedback sometimes leave us confused, trigger defensiveness, or make the world feel darker? And why doesn't it always lead to meaningful change? This session flips the script on feedback. Instead of focusing only on how to give it, we'll explore how to receive itâ€”openly, skillfully, and without defensiveness. Using real examples, we'll dive into both sides of the feedback conversation. Here's what we'll cover: â€¢ Feedback Triggers: Why does feedback sometimes feel like a threat? And why do we react the way we do? â€¢ Receiving Feedback More Skillfully: Practical strategies to manage your reactions and navigate tough feedback moments with greater confidence and psychological comfort. â€¢ Delivering Brain-Friendly Feedback: Learn how to offer feedback that feels safe, reduces defensiveness, and fosters a growth mindset. Whether you lead, collaborate, or simply want to feel more comfortable in feedback conversations, this session will help you turn feedback into a powerful tool for growth.",

Lets understand how Dynamics 365 Field Service works with Business Central out of the box in this introductory session. We'll find out if the perfect couple are getting their relationship started on the front foot, or, is there already trouble in paradise? Field Service has been around for a number of years now with Microsoft, but it working with Business Central has always been a challenge due to no standard integration capabilities. But that has all changed. This session is ideal for those who want to understand a bit more about how Field Service works at a high level, and ultimately how it will (and won't) work with Business Central out of the box, as well as where you can expect to still need some enhancements. Basic understanding of the D365 Sales and Dataverse integration capability with Business Central will help for this session.",

In this session, we explore how ISVs can bridge the gap between partner acquisition and partner adoption. Drawing from in-progress academic research and hands-on experience at POS-ONE, the session shares early insights into why many partners stall after signing up, and what ISVs can do to support them beyond the onboarding email. We'll look at how clear, structured messaging and more intentional enablement processes can equip partners with the tools and confidence they need to position and sell effectively. The content is grounded in both theory and real conversations with partners - what holds them back, what they say they actually need to feel ready to sell, and what motivates them to engage. Whether you're building your partner channel or trying to improve partner outcomes, you'll leave with practical ideas, honest lessons, and a stronger understanding of how to move from sign-up to sell-through.",

This session demonstrates how Dynamics 365 Contact Center and Business Central can be combined to deliver a truly integrated customer service experience, eliminating the need to switch between systems. We'll walk through a real-world scenario: a customer calls to report a defective product. The call is routed through Contact Center, where the agent can instantly access Business Central data (orders, invoices, inventory,..) directly within the Dynamics interface. From the agent's panel, the product's serial number is verified, the issue is logged, and a return is initiated in Business Central, all without leaving the screen. Key takeaways: â€¢ How to embed Business Central data into Contact Center using Dataverse virtual tables â€¢Streamlining support workflows to reduce response times and operational errors â€¢Delivering a consistent, omnichannel experience across voice, WhatsApp, and more Whether you're a developer, consultant, or solution architect, this session will provide practical insights into building connected support experiences that leverage your Business Central deployment to delight your customers.",

We tried so many different approaches to visualizing architecture; flowcharts, UMLs, ERDs, and although they're great approaches, they can often end up too complicated or messy. There's a different light-weight framework that ensures simplicity: Simon Brown's C4 model - making it easier to share your architecture's intricacies, from code dependencies to interconnected services within the Dynamics 365 ecosystem. With the rise of AI-powered coding tools a well thought out architecture leads to a better set of prompts for the agents to work on and minimizes the risk of rework or even having to start from scratch again. Just because we're not typing the code doesn't mean there is no time and cost spent on prompting and reviewing, right? A good architecture in the beginning makes the work with the coding agents and the pipelines more productive and fun. Join this session to discover how the C4-model can transform your team's communication, ensuring success in building and maintaining scalable Business Central solutions. Learn practical insights from Christian, who uses this technique daily to bridge the gap between technical experts and business decision-makers. Ideal for AL developers, solution architects, and team leads working with Business Central.",

    "description": "Tired of piecing together governance as you go? Introducing the AI Business Solutions Governance Compass, a hands-on framework created by Microsoft MVPs Jakub Bajla and Edit Kapcari. It's built from real-world experience to help you move beyond scattered controls toward confident, strategic governance, not just for Power Platform, but for Copilot Studio and Microsoft's evolving AI ecosystem. This session offers a first look at the framework's foundations, showing how proven Power Platform governance principles adapt as AI and Copilots enter the picture. We'll map your governance journey, highlight the maturity curve, and break down Microsoft's growing Copilot landscape (M365, Dynamics, Power Platform, Copilot Studio, Agents). You'll learn how to assess where you are today, what good governance looks like as AI enters the mix, and where to put guardrails around data, security, and user access. Whether you're an admin, developer, or business lead, you'll leave this session with a clear picture of what to focus on, how to reduce risk, and how to help your team grow their skills. Key Talking Points: â€¢ Assessing governance maturity for Power Platform and AI â€¢ What changes when you bring Copilot and Agents into the mix â€¢ Where to set smart guardrails for security and compliance â€¢ How to build a learning and upskilling roadmap for your team Demo: â€¢ Governance maturity model in action â€¢ Building your first Copilot Agent with governance guardrails",

    "description": "They say Business Central only runs on Windows. We say: why not challenge that? In this session, we'll take you through a bold experiment â€” running Business Central on Linux using Docker and Wine. No VMs, no emulation, just a refusal to accept that things must be done the way they've always been. We'll walk through how we got it working, where it got weird, and why it's more than just a tech stunt. Because here's the thing: this setup doesn't just work â€” it brings benefits. Faster test pipelines, fewer resource demands, and the freedom to run on lower-spec hardware. For local devs, build agents, and lean environments, this could open up a whole new world. If this is possible without official support, imagine what could be achieved if Microsoft made the Service Tier truly Linux-compatible. We're not just breaking the rules â€” we're asking if the rules still make sense. And who knows â€” could this even pave the way for full dev environments in Codespaces or devcontainers someday?",

    "description": "Running a taxi company isn't just about getting people from A to Bâ€”it's a high-speed, data-driven balancing act. Think about it: You have thousands of cars moving in real-time. Customers who expect instant service (but also the best price). Traffic jams, flight delays, last-minute cancellations... and yes, that one customer who orders a taxi, then vanishes into thin air. Now, imagine trying to predict where demand will spike, making sure the right taxis are in the right placesâ€”before customers even realize they need a ride. That's exactly what one of Scandinavia's largest taxi companies set out to do.

    "description": "Consuming 3rd party APIs has become a standard task for a lot of BC developers and organizations. However, this typically means a dependency on a 3rd party who need to make test systems available, maintain the data or even provide a setup for CI/CD. In this session, you will see how you can get rid of that dependency through a (free and open source) tool called WireMock to make your dev and test workflows a lot easier. We will also look into the opposite scenario: If you have additional client applications (a mobile app, a web frontend, a Power App ...) consuming your BC APIs, it also makes live easier to not depend on an actual BC instance. After this session, you will have a good overview of the tool, but also have seen in-depth demos about it's usage for both scenarios.",

But sometimes, no matter how well the code is written, an operation simply takes time. Large data volumes, complex processes, or external dependencies can make certain tasks inherently slow. This is where perception of performance becomes just as important as actual performance. This session focuses on how to maintain a responsive and user-friendly experience, even when heavy work is happening in the background. Techniques will be covered that allow long-running operations to be handled without blocking the user interface, helping users stay productive and engaged. Key concepts and practical approaches for offloading processing and improving perceived performance will be explained, providing a foundation for building smoother, more responsive Business Central solutions.",

I started with BC while still in university, and for a long time, I wrestled with impostor syndrome. Was I even a real developer? Was ERP just a temporary detour? Should I switch to a \"real\" job? Now, as I approach 30, I've come to realize just how many doors this industry can open. And I'm not alone. Over the past 9 months, I've spoken with MVPs, consultants, developers, and leaders to map out the career paths people have taken - and the ones still ahead. This isn't a session about attracting young talent. It's about keeping it. If you're under 30, come explore what this industry can offer. If you're over 30, join to see how you can support and retain the talent that will shape the future of Business Central.",

Sporadic company posts and recycled corporate content on LinkedIn don't cut it. Anxious experts lurk but rarely post, fearing saying the \"wrong thing\". Others post AI-generated content and flood the platform with annoying messages that get ignored. And yet, research shows employee-shared content reaches 561% more people than company messagesâ€”if done right. If you're a forward-thinking Dynamics partner who wants to lead the conversation and build thought leadership as a team, this one is for you. This hands-on workshop transforms your team into confident brand ambassadors who attract Microsoft sellers, ideal partners, and customers whilst building trust. Through interactive exercises, real-time profile optimisation, and meaningful AI tool usage, you'll cut through noise with genuine expertise. What You'll Learn: â€¢ Profile Optimisation: Polish personal profiles with messaging that connects, expands reach, and balances individual expertise with company positioning â€¢ Strategic Content Planning: Define weekly talking points aligning personal voices with business goals whilst attracting the right prospects and partners â€¢ Human-First AI Integration: Create high-performing posts using AI assistants without sounding robotic Ideal for partners ready to build expert-based LinkedIn presence that grows network, impact, and business opportunities through personal perspectives.",

    "description": "In times of organizational transformation, leadership must evolve. At knk, the shift to self-organized teams challenged traditional leadership modelsâ€”and sparked bold experimentation. Initially, we considered eliminating formal leadership roles entirely. That approach failed. But from failure came insight. After two leaders left, we piloted a new model: choose your own leaderâ€”regardless of department or hierarchy. This radical idea gave employees the autonomy to select someone they trust and align with, whether from their own team or another. The goal? Foster ownership, acceptance trust, and cross-functional collaboration. In this session, we'll share how we designed and implemented this model, the options we considered, and what we learned along the way. You'll hear directly from Dorothee Werner (CEO), who spearheaded the change, and Julia Redner, who participated as a chosen leader in the matchmaking process. We'll explore what's working, where we're still learning, and how this approach reshapes leadership in a modern, agile organization.",

    "description": "When implementing Power Platform or Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement solutions within smaller organisations, security baseline controls are typically not a huge concern. But as you start to promote and implement these solutions within larger enterprises, you will often encounter several challenges when explaining, justifying and convincing IT teams that the solution you're implementing can align with existing organisational standards and that some of the frequently voiced promises of the solution don't accidentally cause a compliance or legal nightmare. So, how best can we balance this while ensuring we can deliver value, agility and opportunity using low-code tools? To help you navigate this minefield, join me in this informative, illustrative and kooky session. I will explain and demonstrate the most crucial baseline configurations to apply within any environment leveraging Microsoft Dataverse or one of the many different Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement apps. Based on real-world experiences working within several enterprise environments, attendees will walk away with a firm understanding of several essential, common sense-led steps to improve the posture of any new or existing environment and keep any information security challenges at bay. Make your Dataverse shine with its dazzling security posture by attending this session!",

Are users clarifying their tasks? Questioning model quality? Reporting confusion? Without answers, it's hard to decide whether to retrain models, educate users, or redesign the agent architecture. In this session, we present a practical framework that uses LLM-based classification to characterize user intent. Each incoming user message is automatically labeled by type (clarification, feedback, additional info, etc.), forming a structured event log for analysis. We'll walk through: - Using Microsoft Copilot Studio to enrich agent telemetry and route structured data to Application Insights - Applying LLM pipelines to tag conversation intents - Leveraging Power Automate Process Mining to detect interaction bottlenecks and user friction points - Making actionable decisions: from training material improvements to architecture redesign This is a highly practical, demo-driven session for: - Power Platform developers building AI-powered solutions - Architects designing conversational interfaces - System analysts optimizing Copilot usage in enterprise environments Join us to discover how structured data and process insights can turn black-box agent behavior into measurable, improvable systems.",

While Business Central offers robust ERP functionality, it assumes unlimited capacity â€” a limitation that the PlanningBoard effectively addresses. We will highlight key planning challenges such as limited material availability, delayed procurement, and production bottlenecks, and demonstrate how the PlanningBoard supports better coordination across purchasing, production, and sales. Real-world use cases will show how delivery dates can be validated more reliably, how disruptions in the supply chain are managed, and how realistic scheduling leads to more transparency and control. This session is ideal for production planners, operations managers, and IT professionals looking to enhance their planning capabilities beyond standard ERP features.",

You'll learn how to: - Seamlessly connect Business Central to modern and legacy systems - Leverage patterns for resilience, scalability, and message durability - Use Azure messaging components the right way at the right time - Build integrations that talk to anything from AI engines to banking systems This isn't just theory, it's code, demos, and real-world experience you can take back to your customers. This session is for you if you're ready to go beyond the basics and bring messaging patterns to life.",

We will use real-life examples that seem to be impossible to implement without the RDLC report layout. Together, we will discover some hidden gems in this methodology. This workshop is not about new functionalities. It is not about new possibilities. It is about what is already there, but for some reason, it was hidden from us.

It moves partners beyond one-off integrations to a unified data and integration platform that enables scale, resilience, and innovation.

Microsoft's exclude functionality is a small update with massive impact and yet, many teams still overlook it. In this high-impact session, you'll discover how to radically simplify permission setup using exclude. We'll show you how to build lean, secure, and fully functional authorizations in 1 or 2 days, instead of weeks.

    "description": "What happens when you stop writing code and start managing an AI that writes it for you? Over the past few months, I've conducted an experiment: letting AI agents handle most of my software development work while I focused on directing, reviewing, and fixing what they produced. The results were eye-opening: both thrilling and terrifying. In this 45-minute session, I'll share the unfiltered reality of \"vibe coding\" with AI agents, including: - The productivity paradise: How AI can outmatch your output 10x on greenfield projects when everything goes right. - The maintenance nightmare: Why \"machines can read any code\" doesn't mean they can maintain any code. - The dangerous comfort zone: How prompting instead of coding creates a slippery slope toward irrelevance. - The knowledge trap: Why understanding the output becomes more critical than ever, and what happens when you don't. Whether you're a developer, functional consultant, or technical decision-maker, this session will help you navigate the rapidly evolving landscape where AI is becoming your programming partner, competitor, and replacement (probably in that same order).",

    "description": "When clients call with \"we need something that tracks X by next week,\" most developers cringe. But what if that ambiguity could become your competitive advantage? Partners who rapidly translate business problems into working solutions win more deals and keep clients happier. Most senior developers hate this idea. No spec? No backlog grooming? But we already work this way - vague requests, half-baked ideas, last-minute \"can-you-just\" tasks are real life. Vibe-Driven Development embraces that reality, showing how AI turns ambiguity into competitive advantage. We'll take a loosely defined business need and use GitHub Copilot to shape it into a full Business Central solution, from design and development through documentation, testing, and delivery. You'll learn how to: â€¢ Break down fuzzy requests using AI prompts â€¢ Use AI for architecture and naming decisions â€¢ Generate AL scaffolding, test codeunits, and release notes â€¢ Identify critical review points where human expertise must override AI, particularly around Business Central's posting frameworks, permission design, and integration patterns This isn't about replacing your expertise, it's about accelerating delivery when you're handed a problem and a deadline. Whether skeptical or curious, you'll leave with a new perspective on how AI supports the way you already work while maintaining quality standards.",

    "description": "Two years ago, we tackled \"what even is AI\" and I think we now have a pretty good grasp on what these language models are all about. And yet, it feels like we're back to square one... Because we have a new buzzword in town - Agents! Before we all rush in to implement them, let's stop for a moment and talk about what even is an agent. How do they compare to Copilot Features? How do they actually work? Will we just be managing a fleet of agents in the future? Or should we perhaps still invest in core functionality? Join this session to figure out if Agents are the future... or just another distraction.",
