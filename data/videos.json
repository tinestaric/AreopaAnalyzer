The price, skills needed, dev ops practices, source control, maintainability... Some are valid, and some are not anymore. Well, here's a session that's going to structure them.\nThis is not a session where we rant on Power Platform. This is a session where we help the PP audience understand why we're not hearing their message, and a session for the BC partners, trying to venture in the world of PP, so they know what they can expect.

    "description": "Do you want to know what my first experience with generative AI was? Wildly inconsistent results. Half the time, the response wasn‚Äôt in JSON so I could parse it, and when it did work, it was slow. The problem? My prompts were bad. So, I started figuring out how to make them better.\n\nWhat structure works best? How to determine the best temperature level? Should I care about function calling? Will my prompts perform well with 100 users?\n\nThe more I figured out how to use generative AI, the more I realized I was becoming a ‚Äúprompt engineer‚Äù. You know, the thing that‚Äôs supposed to replace all developers in the future. I‚Äôm not sure about that. But in the AI era, we need to know how to work with it.\n\nIf you‚Äôd like to skip all the trial-and-error steps, join this session to learn how to take your prompts from a simple request that returns wildly inconsistent results to a complex prompt that makes your new AI features more stable and reliable.\n\nPresenter: Tine Stariƒç\nModerator : Bert Verbeek\n\n00:03:09 - Introduction\n00:06:31 - Introduction Tine\n00:07:57 - Agenda\n00:09:18 - Build prompts with structure and examples‚Äã\n00:16:08 - How do you build a good prompt (1)\n00:16:28 - Prompting techniques\n-- 00:16:41 - Few Shot learning\n-- 00:18:53 - Chain of Though\n-- 00:21:19 - Prompt Reinforcement/Anchoring\n00:23:08 - How do you build a good prompt (2)\n-- 00:23:50 - Instructions\n-- 00:24:30 - Steps\n-- 00:25:40 - Format Requirements\n-- 00:25:56 - Examples\n-- 00:26:08 - Notes\n00:26:25 - How do you build a good prompt (3)\n-- 00:26:46 - Shortcut to a good prompt\n00:30:05 - Use model capabilities to your advantage‚Äã\n-- 00:30:28 - JSON Mode\n-- 00:32:00 - Tool calling\n-- 00:39:13 - Prompt Guides\n00:40:35 - Testing Prompts\n-- 00:43:21 - Meta prompts\n00:45:36 - Testing prompts (2)\n-- 00:47:15 - AI Test Toolkit\n00:48:37 - How do you build a good prompt (4) - Recap\n00:49:27 - Thank you ... and a tip!\n00:50:00 - Q & A",

    "description": "One of the common requirements in Dynamics 365 Business Central projects is to efficiently handle integrations between systems, to handle complex processing of documents or complex message orchestrations and to overcome the operation limits of Business Central APIs. Low-code approaches for creating such workflows are often one of the first technical choices for Business Central partners. But partners that start in the wrong way (for example abusing of Power Automate) quite immediately run into a variety of problems such as poor performances, scalability, and unsatisfactory throughput for handling their processes. How to solve these common problems?\r\nAzure Logic Apps provide a way to simplify and implement scalable integrations and workflows in the cloud. In this session we'll go in depth into the new Azure Logic Apps Standard platform and we'll see how to use a set of new features (currently in preview) for creating high performance low-code workflows for Dynamics 365 Business Central. We'll see how we can use Visual Studio Code for designing our stateless and stateful workflows, how to inject custom .NET code in actions where performances are poor, how to efficiently handle large batch data processing and how to design workflows for high throughput.\r\nThis session will change the way you will design your Business Central future integrations! It will show you lots of new and upcoming features and it will provide tips and real-world scenarios for creating workflows that flies.\r\n\r\nPresenter: Stefano Demiliani\r\nModerator: Luc van Vugt\r\n\r\n00:04:09 - Introduction Stefano\r\n00:04:35 - Objectives\r\n00:05:35 - Low-code everywhere\r\n-- 00:05:35 - Low-code workflows\r\n00:10:12 - Power Automate vs. Azure Logic Apps\r\n-- 00:10:12 - Low-code workflows in BC\r\n-- 00:14:35 - Azure Logic Apps\r\n---- 00:14:35 - models - Consumption vs. Standard\r\n---- 00:17:19 - workflow types\r\n---- 00:19:36 - demo\r\n00:30:52 - Real world scenario\r\n00:37:48 - Low-code workflows: what you need to know\r\n00:39:53 - New: _mixed solution_ - using local function\r\n--  00:40:55 - Creating in VS Code\r\n00:53:35 - Azure Logic Apps: reliability\r\n00:55:43 - Conclusions\r\n01:02:51 - Q & A",

However, this is probably where all knowledge about ‚Äúmocks‚Äù ends for you ‚Äì if you are like most other AL developers, you have never written a ‚Äúmock‚Äù, you have never used one, and very likely you don‚Äôt know that ‚Äúmock‚Äù is just one of five types of test doubles.\r\nTest doubles are one of the most important and most powerful tools in any developer‚Äôs toolbox: they allow writing efficient, fast performing, focused tests that require less setup and put less stress on the system.\r\nThis webinar will present five different types of test doubles: dummies, spies, stubs, fakes, and mocks. You will see these doubles in action in real-life test code, and you will see how each of them helps you in its own right.\r\nAfter this webinar, you‚Äôll be able to identify situations in which to use each of these different test doubles and how to write them.

However, this is not the end of the road. If you need more flexible and scalable environments where you combine the resources of multiple virtual machines, Docker Swarm is an easy to setup, Windows-only option. And the answer for on-demand highly scalable SQL is of course Azure SQL. In this session, you will see how you can combine those two technologies to create a Business Central container environment that can on demand provide whatever resources you need.\r\n\r\nPlease note that a lot of the same ground was covered in the TechDays session \"Make the most out of Business Central containers\"\r\n\r\nSpeaker: Tobias Fenster | tobias.fenster@cosmoconsult.com\r\nModerator: David Singleton",

But in addition to the advantages, in my experience there are also disadvantages to working with Events, especially if we as developers do not approach it in a structured way, and in particular in the Event Subscribers. Examples where these Event Subscribers may get in the way are during Data Upgrades, debugging and in the example that led me to this session; easy separation of code per company.\r\nTo solve my challenge I started working with the Discovery Event Pattern and realized that I am also offering solutions for other challenges related to Events. In this session we will look together at the objects with which we can offer users an interface to control the Event Subscribers and how the handling of the code shifts to the same Subscribers. We also briefly discuss other possible applications of this functionality, especially with look view to the future of Dynamics 365 Business Central.\r\n                \r\nSpeaker: Martin Oomen\r\nModerator: Jascha Vincke and Luc van Vugt\r\n\r\nAreopa webinars news letter http://eepurl.com/gHOJWf\r\n\r\nUpcoming webinars are listed on\r\nhttps://areopa.academy/",

But what if you want a second or more additional containers? Creating them and using them directly on the VM is no problem, again thanks to Freddy Kristiansen's navcontainerhelper, but if you want to access them from your laptop or somewhere else outside of the Azure VM, it gets a bit more complicated. In this webinar you will get an explanation of the technical background and also an easy way to work around that limitation and prepare Azure VMs for multiple containers conveniently as well.
